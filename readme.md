#Christ Community Church

Basic info: site built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator and developed and hosted on Github.

Mason is currently the admin of the repository and the only other person with push access to the repo, if you are interested in contributing to the website, please contact Mason at [masonfox22@gmail.com](mailto:masonfox22@gmail.com)

##Editing site prerequisites:
1. Speak with Mason Fox and or Chris
2. Have or set up a github account
3. Download the Github app
4. Download [Atom](https://atom.io) Text Editor (It is free and made by Github)
5. Understand usage of Github so we don't kill the site (will link video here)

##Setting up Jekyll & Site directory:

1. Install Jekyll
  * Run: ~ $ gem install jekyll (may require sudo on Mac)
2. Tap the "Clone in Desktop Button" on the repository or clone from app
  * Save the file name as something small, like ccc
3. Navigate to the directory (Mine is in my home folder for easy access)
  * cd (change directory) into your git file (the one you just cloned)
  * Type ls to view all of the files

##Using Jekyll & Github:

There only two important Jekyll commands that we have at our disposal: Serve (s) and build (b).

These can be executed by:

> Jekyll (task)
* i.e s for serve or b build.

 ###DO NOT EDIT THE SITE FILE
 Editing the 

###Serve or s:
 This will serve up a local environment for you to view the code. Jekyll's serve will automatically change text changes when a save is executed (this is not the case in styling or yaml file changes)

###Build or b
Build is used to compile the site directory. Editing the site file and generating the site file with build will overwrite all changes.

##Pull Request

1. Go to git hub app
2. Commit changes (accurate commit info and summaries please)
3. Instead of "syncing", please submit a pull request to the master branch (should be default)

###Other Info

*Please make detailed commits and summaries when working on large portions of code
