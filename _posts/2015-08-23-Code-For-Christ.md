  Interested in web technology? Already know some about it? Help us maintain our website and learn more about the web and how to write code by contributing to the maintenance of the website!

#####So, you want to contribute?
The website does not maintain itself and we are looking for a group of people, whether young or older, to help contribute to our website. First of all, what does contribute mean? Great question! Contribute in relation to our website can mean many things! It can mean:

* Updating / Writing content
* Adding Photos
* Linking Soundcloud sermons
* Fixing HTML & CSS Glitches
* And more

#####But I don't have any experience in coding!
The beauty of this project is that our website is written alongside a program that allows users who may not have experience with code the ability to get their hands wet! A majority of support of the website will be managing/updating content, but assistance with handling code would also be a plus.

You are welcome to join the team as long as your have a desire to learn and the dedication to this learning!

#####Get Started! Jump Right In!

Feel free to contact <a href="mailto:cccwebtech@gmail.com">cccwebtech@gmail.com</a> if you are interested in contributing to the website! Once again, knowledge of web technologies is not required, but a desire to learn is!
